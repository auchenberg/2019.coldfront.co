                <p>Back in 2014 we had travel to other major european cities such as Amsterdam, London, Berlin, London, New York and San Francisco to be a part of our global front-end community, but with ColdFront we changed that.</p>
                <p>ColdFront is a conference for front-end developers who are passionate about building user experiences with the latest and most relevant technologies. Over the past years the term “front-end” has transitioned from meaning building experiences for the web, to be covering a broad span of platforms, devices and runtimes.</p>

                <h3>The ColdFront name</h3>
                <p>The name ColdFront expresses the aim to create events that’s on the forefront of the future, and is a mix of the words “cold” as a reference to the cold Scandinavia climate  and “front” referring to the front-end disciplin.</p>

                title="Our principles and manifest"
                text="To guide the content for ColdFront we have outlined the following principles that helps us decide what content that is relevant for the conference:"
            />

            <div className="narrow">
                <h4>Our format</h4>
                <p>ColdFront is a single-track conference, and a ColdFront talk is maximum 45 minutes long. After each 2 session block, a 15 min break will follow to allow attendees to stretch their legs.</p>

                <h4>Why instead of how</h4>
                <p>We want to hear talks that focuses on the “why” instead of the practical “how”. By this we mean that we would rather hear a talk that provides the reasons and perspective on a given technology or framework, than the “how to” on how to use the technology or framework. </p>

                <h4>Perspective over tutorials</h4>
                <p>We want talks that provides perspective, new ways of thinking, and puts today’s landscape into the perspective of tomorrow. If the content can be read in a tutorial, it’s not a ColdFront talk.</p>

                <h4>Technologies and trends</h4>
