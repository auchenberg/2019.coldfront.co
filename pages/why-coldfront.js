                <h2>A holistic front-end conference</h2>
                <p>ColdFront is a unique two-day international conference for front-end and mobile developers in Copenhagen on November 13-14-15th 2018. The front-end role has evolved, and building modern interfaces requires you to be present on many platforms regardless of the technology.</p>

                <p>At Coldfront 2018, we will take a look at the entire stack by throwing a two day conference for everyone who are passionate about building front-ends and interfaces. So whether you are a iOS, Android, mobile, web, frontender or something in between, ColdFront is the place to be.</p>
